document1 = """The Ceph File System, or CephFS, is a POSIX-compliant file system built on top of Ceph’s distributed object store, RADOS. 
               CephFS endeavors to provide a state-of-the-art, multi-use, highly available, and performant file store for a variety of applications, 
               including traditional use-cases like shared home directories, HPC scratch space, and distributed workflow shared storage.
               CephFS achieves these goals through the use of some novel architectural choices. Notably, file metadata is stored in a separate 
               RADOS pool from file data and served via a resizable cluster of Metadata Servers, or MDS, which may scale to support higher throughput
               metadata workloads. Clients of the file system have direct access to RADOS for reading and writing file data blocks. For this reason, 
               workloads may linearly scale with the size of the underlying RADOS object store; that is, there is no gateway or broker mediating data I/O for 
               clients."""
